# A weighted colored Box 
A Box is associated with following attributes:
```
  unique id
  length
  breadth
  height
  color
  weight
```
### Write seperate functions to perform the following operations:
* Create an collection(array or linked list) of boxes using dynamic memory
* Add a box at end of the collection
* Display the state of all boxes
* Find the box with given id
* Count all boxes with specified color
* Find average volume of all boxes
* Find the difference between box with min volume and box with max volume
* Find the box which has maximum height
* Update weight of box having a given id
* Remove the Box with given id
* Create a structure to define Weighted Colored Box as encapsulated unit (Single structure with pointer to data and pointer to functions)

## Guidelines
* Use dynamic memory allocation for arrays and structures.
* Return appropriate results from all the functions instead of printing.
* Follow Modular programming and multifile approach
* Create Makefile with targets for compiling and testing, analysis and coverage.
* Follow best practices while writing the code.
