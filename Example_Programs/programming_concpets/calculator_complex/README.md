# Time to code
## Problem Statement
* Write functions to compute **Sum**, **Difference**, **Product** and **Division** of two **Complex numbers** of the below structure.
```
typedef struct complex_t {
    float real;
    float imaginary;
} complex_t;
```

## Guidelines:
### Programming
* **Do not use scanf functions**. Assume test values for arguments to functions.
* Implement different functions for each operation instead of writing everything under main function.
* Create a **header file**,  **source code file** and **test file**.
* Use **Dynamic memory** wherever possible.

### Tool usage
* Write **Unit test** cases for each function.
* **Makefile** for **compilation**, **running test** cases and additional targets.
* Create **Documentation** using **Doxygen**.
* Use **cppcheck** and **Valgrind** tools to analyze the code.
