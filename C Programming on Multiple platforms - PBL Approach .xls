Let the two players be named as Tom and Jerry. For every continuous subsequence of candies stacks, Tom and Jerry will play game on this subsequence of candies stacks, Tom plays first, and they play in turn. In one move, the player can choose one of the stacks and remove at least one candy from it keeping in mind the non-decreasing order of the candies stacks which needs to be maintained. The last person to make a valid move wins.

We need to find the continuous subsequences of candies stacks that will make Tom win if both of them play optimally. The number of candies of each stack will be recovered after the game ends for each subsequences."

When people get in the lift, they enter their desired floor number. Several numbers can be requested at a time. After all numbers have been entered, the door is closed by pressing the close door number (the return key). Each time the door closes, the lift checks to see if there are any floors in the current direction (up or down). If there are, then it services these floors first, starting with the closest one to the current floor. If there are no floors requiring stops in the current directions, it checks the opposite direction, again servicing the floor closest to the current floor. If the lift is not moving (direction STOP), then it services up requests before down requests. Each time, the elevator arrives at a floor, new passengers can get on and request a floor. The new requests are added to the ones still pending, and the lifts again evaluates which floor and which lift will be processed first."
