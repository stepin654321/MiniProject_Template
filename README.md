* hello fellow LTTS step in peer, this is still work in progress I have not added any documentation yet because I don't know how to do it, but I am learning, submission is on 17th * right?

* if you're cloning to try the game pls read:
* 1) run `make` in your working repo that you clone or download and extract
* 2) go to the folder `/build`
* 3) run the Tetris.out.out from another cmd window (type cmd on your file hierarchy when you're in build)
* 4) tetrisNoHold will start in that window
* 5) update this readme with your score!!11!1!
* 6) leave your thoughts and suggestions


* yes it will crash in the middle randomly, C is buggy and windows is unstable
