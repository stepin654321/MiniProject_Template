* https://github.com/kimkyeongnam/Tetris


* hello fellow LTTS step in peer, this is still work in progress I have not added any documentation yet because I don't know how to do it, but I am learning, submission is on 17th * right?

* if you're cloning to try the game pls read:
1) run `make` in your working repo that you clone or download and extract
2) go to the folder `/build`
3) run the Tetris.out.out from another cmd window (type cmd on your file hierarchy when you're in build)
4) tetrisNoHold will start in that window
5) update this readme with your score!!11!1!
6) leave your thoughts and suggestions


* yes it will crash in the middle randomly, C is buggy and windows is unstable
